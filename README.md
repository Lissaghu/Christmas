# Project link [Christmas](https://lissaghu-christmas.netlify.app/)(Desktop version)

### It's a game called grandma's toys. Your task is to choose toys, you can sort them by year of purchase and name, as well as filter by shape, color, year of purchase, size and favorite grandmothers. Next, you can hang your chosen toys on the tree, you can also choose a tree and background, turn on music and snow.
In this project, I decided to use TypeScript, it was very interesting and not easy enough. Also, for the first time I encountered multiple sorting and filtering, I thought for a very long time how to write the main filtering method.
I also used the SPA approach, but instead of template strings, I used the <template> HTML tag because the code in this case is more readable than template strings - ``. First time working with Drag and Drop API.

***Used technologies:***
- TypeScript (using Classes and Local Storage)
- SCSS/SASS
- Webpack
- ESLint
- Prettier
